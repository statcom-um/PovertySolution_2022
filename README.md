## Help with version control (git)

[Jean Morrison](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/morrison-jean.html) from the Department of Biostatistics at UM has a wonderful [website](https://jean997.github.io/rr_tools/) talking about reproducible research tools and practices. If you haven't had a lot of experience with version control, please consider heading over to the [section](https://jean997.github.io/rr_tools/version_control.html) on git. It's a very helpful resource. [Dan Barker](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/staff_profiles/barker-dan.html) recorded this helpful [video](https://www.mivideo.it.umich.edu/media/t/1_iut23fhb) to help with git+github as well.
